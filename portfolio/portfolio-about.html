      <h1>Allison Fu</h1>
      <p>My name is Xueqing Fu (付雪晴), and I go by Allison. I am a senior at Mizzou, studying Data Journalism.
      <br> I attend Mizzou through a dual degree program between Communication University of China and University of Missouri- Columbia. I finished my first two years of college in Beijing, which is also my hometown.</p>

    <p> Oddly enough, I am taking 4450 as a senior, in my last semester at Mizzou. I have forced myself to a place where I do not have alternatives but hang it there.<br>
Last semester, I dropped the reporting class, for my lack of time and confidence. <br>In the past week, I cried myself to bed several times, simply because I don’t think I will be able to make through. Plus, I do not know how to express my fear and discomfort to my family and friend.
Though I showed up in the budget meeting three times, I felt like an outsider. </p>

  <p>Tomorrow it will be my first GA shift. Am I terrified? Hell, yes. Did I cry last night? Yep, till 2 a.m. As an introvert person, I guess I will never overcome the fear of doing reporting. <br>I was having a really hard time at J2100, sometimes I just couldn't take the brutal honesty. Not once have I doubted why I chose journalism as my major? Well, I indeed enjoy the feeling of sharing others' stories and being immersed in data. The combination of both is just the best thing I can ever think of.<br> Hopefully, things will go smoothly when the sun rises.</p>

    <p>To be frank, I was worried that I don’t have enough time to have it written or people wouldn't be willing to talk to me when it comes to homelessness. <br>
Things turned out to be okay. Time passed more quickly than I expected. Also, I didn’t get the time to be panic or be stressed out. All I can think of is to have everything done as best as can. <br><br>

Besides, it’s my first time feeling frustrated for losing a potential story to another reporter. It's about the Spring Festival gala. The subject itself holds significant meaning to Chinese and the time, the breakout of the coranovirus in China, is sensitive to every Chinese.
I was a child when SARS happened. Being required to stay home is the only memory I have of that pandemic. Now in 2020, I feel like a coward because of my detachment and my limited capability. Not only am I worried for my grandparents who lives a strret across the hospital, but also I feel guilty for not helping with anything. I should have donated medical masks days ealier. I should have warned my parents to keep their money from the market before the Spring Festival.
Now it seems to late.
