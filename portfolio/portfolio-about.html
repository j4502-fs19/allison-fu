      <h1>Allison Fu</h1>
      <p>My name is Xueqing Fu (付雪晴), and I go by Allison. I am a senior at Mizzou, studying Data Journalism.
      <br> I attend Mizzou through a dual degree program between Communication University of China and University of Missouri- Columbia. I finished my first two years of college in Beijing, which is also my hometown.</p>

    <h1>1/23</h1>
    <p> Oddly enough, I am taking 4450 as a senior, in my last semester at Mizzou. I have forced myself to a place where I do not have alternatives but hang it there.<br>
Last semester, I dropped the reporting class, for my lack of time and confidence. <br>In the past week, I cried myself to bed several times, simply because I don’t think I will be able to make through. Plus, I do not know how to express my fear and discomfort to my family and friend.
Though I showed up in the budget meeting three times, I felt like an outsider. </p>

  <p>Some media are blaming Wuhanese for bring the disease to the entire nation and rest of the world, calling them perpetrators for traveling thousands of miles while on fever. Though the pandemic was first found in Wuhan and might be linked to the unsanitary food they consumed at the market. Do we really have to felonize their willingness to come home over Spring Festival and ignorance about the disease. <br>
Though there may be millions of Chinese taking the university entrance exam and there may be thousands of International student overseas, yet the college graduates only take up 5% of the total population. An average Chinese only spend 7.4 years in school, compared to 13+ years in the U.S.. How can we expect a 7th grade student to react calmly and self-quarantine for 14 days when it comes to disease and horror?<br>
My family lives a street across a top-ranked hospital, I saw patients visiting the hospital with their pillows and blankets ever since I was a child. I can still recall the pain and despair on their face. They are individuals who breathe and live not just numbers. It is ridiculously arrogant for media to blame the public.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow it will be my first GA shift. Am I terrified? Hell, yes. Did I cry last night? Yep, till 2 a.m. As an introvert person, I guess I will never overcome the fear of doing reporting. <br>I was having a really hard time at J2100, sometimes I just couldn't take the brutal honesty. Not once have I doubted why I chose journalism as my major? Well, I indeed enjoy the feeling of sharing others' stories and being immersed in data. The combination of both is just the best thing I can ever think of.<br> Hopefully, things will go smoothly when the sun rises.</p>

    <p>To be frank, I was worried that I don’t have enough time to have it written or people wouldn't be willing to talk to me when it comes to homelessness. <br>
Things turned out to be okay. Time passed more quickly than I expected. Also, I didn’t get the time to be panic or be stressed out. All I can think of is to have everything done as best as can. <br><br>

Besides, it’s my first time feeling frustrated for losing a potential story to another reporter. It's about the Spring Festival gala. The subject itself holds significant meaning to Chinese and the time, the breakout of the coranovirus in China, is sensitive to every Chinese.<br>
I was a child when SARS happened. Being required to stay home is the only memory I have of that pandemic. Now in 2020, I feel like a coward because of my detachment and my limited capability. Not only am I worried for my grandparents who lives a strret across the hospital, but also I feel guilty for not helping with anything. I should have donated medical masks days ealier. I should have warned my parents to keep their money from the market before the Spring Festival.
Now it seems to late.

    <p>Though the coronavirus is not affecting me directly, nor do I notice the hostility against Chinese that happened in many places of the world, I can relate myself to some of the posts on social media. We are extremely vulnerable while facing hostility. As a Chinese living abroad, I felt the loneliness and rootlessness ever since my flight arrived in Seattle, 2018. <br>
I got even more cautious when the coronavirus broke out. How should I react if people treat me as a virus carrier? How should respond if anyone calls me a bat/dog eater? Chineses tourists got their notoriety for being disrespectful and rude.  At the time, my instinctive reaction is that “it’s not me.” Yet, I am a part of the larger community. The pride being a Chinese will always be with me, so is the guilt. Studying journalism makes the two ever more striking my life.<br>
I don’t know how others balance the pride and guilt.

      <p>
        I just read an article about the high correlation of Middle East respiratory syndrome spread with Google search and Twitter trends in Korea. I am wondering whether this pattern shares similarity with the spread of the coronavirus. Search engines and social media are two major platforms that people use to know about the coronavirus. I am curious in how people’s awareness change over time. Since, it took more than a month for the incident to unfold. None of us paid much attention back in December 2019. Plus, China has its unique internet environment. Becasuse of the firewall, we do not Facebook, Twitter, Youtube or Instagram. All social media are localized, which makes the trend and the spread of the virus more interesting. What role does the government censorship play in the process? Many warnings from the whistleblowers were treated as rumors and many posts are diliberatly deleted.
        Also, will there be any difference in related to keywords searching between China and the U.S.. Will the geographical distance between two countries affect their audiences' understanding and attitude? In addition, the situation of the virus and number of infected vary drastically between these two.

  <h1>2/15</h1>
  <p>To the fourth week of the class, I am getting a bit worried about my performance in the class. I haven’t contributed as much as I should over the past few weeks. I am doing what I was required, posting regularly on my website, showing up as frequently as possible, reading the paper, having interviews for my orientation assignment. Yet, I only have written during my GA shift. Personally, I do not feel comfortable writing on DDL, for which I missed several opportunities.<br>

Admittedly, I am struggling to stay on track. This never happened before, and I do not want to end up in giving up again. I have always been dedicated and involved in classes. Limited time is not an excuse for my lack of participation. It’s the path I chose. <br>

Plus, during my interview with Osasu Osaze, a doctoral student from Nigeria, I could personally relate to the feeling of being separated from the family. Because of the visa restriction, his family in Nigeria is unlikely to visit. And it’s too risky to go back. Osasu has to re-apply for his visa seven times to get back to MU and continue his study. <br>

Most likely, none of my parents will be able to come for my graduation, because of the cancellation of flights between the U.S. and China. </p>

    <p>Seeing Hannah’s reporting on the Spring Festival Gala, I reach out to Yang Li again. I am more than curious about her reaction to the extremely low attendance rate. I briefly talked to her before about the delay of the Gala and the reaction from the Chinese community towards the coronavirus. Beforehand, I only heard rumors. I have no doubt that it is polarized.
      <br>Four out of five co-organizers pulled from the event. She also has to bear the pressure from her own board members. Not mention the fear every individual has about the virus and its unpredictability.
As a Chinese, I am so appreciated that her organization, Columbia Friends of China, stayed. It’s not because of the culture or tradition, but it bridged me to my family. I indeed feel closer to my family, though being physically apart.

I was fascinated by what Scott mentioned in lecture. Sourcing is also apart to framing, I tried to see how the sourcing process works in reporting foreign news. Latest reporting of China by the New York Times, nine articles are directly related to the coronavirus, covering a large variety of aspects. For example, two stories provided a live update of the pandemic, reported and researched by a team. Three articles featured on individuals which are unexpected, unfortunate but relatable to the general public. For instance, May tells the story of a woman after being stranded by coronavirus travel bans (May, Feb. 10, 2020). Qin shares the despair of a family of three generations after being infected (Qin, Feb.9, 2020). What prejudices are Wuhan natives facing (Mozur, Feb.8, 2020)? How does the central government react to the wide spreading of the virus (Buckley and Myers, Feb.10, 2020)? What do doctors and labs do to keep up with the testing demands (Wee, Feb.9, 2020)? Having correspondents and a bureau in China, the New York Times is able to create an impression of the coronavirus with depth and solidarity, by reporting the story from individuals as well as the government.
<br>
<br>
Media coverage of China also goes hand in hand with foreign policy. When China and Russia are seen as revisionist power, the antagonism can be noticed in news coverage in lines such as “Where’s Xi? China’s leader commands coronavirus fight from safe heights (Buckley and Myers, Feb.10, 2020)?” There is sarcasm embedded in the contraction between the safe heights and the danger of the virus.

      <h1>2/22</h1>
      <p>
        I used to have a lot of fear for this class, such as being afraid of showing up in the newsroom, terrified of talking to my editor. I will have to reset and get myself back in track, though I still don't know what the right track is.
        <br><br>
        I stopped by this year's Picture of the Year at the Smith Forum. It's such a gratifying 30 minutes, just pictures and silence. I do remember reading an essay by Keith Greenwood about the framing of Syrian refuees. . Framing, a selective decision about what to include, is adopted by photojournalists to attract attention. While framing migrations, photos presented in class captured their daily life, emotions and actions of refugees. Among all the pictures showed in class, the photo portraying the back of a Syrian woman is extremely captivating to me. She was so emaciated that we can see every single bone. Just like Edgar Degas’ painting of ballerinas, a glimpse of other’s life bridges the audience to the subject. As if I am in the camp in Turkey myself, going through malnutrition and the war. Though framing is subjective, people generally accept photos as being closer to the truth. Thus, focusing on Syrian refugees is likely to promote awareness in the western world and bolster support for the “victims.”

        <br><br>
        Yet, photos do have their limits. As Dr. Greenwood said, they capture the moment but lack context. Most photos entered the competition focused on the process of migration instead of the result. For instance, how millions of Syrian refugees settled down in Germany and how they assimilated into the western world? Based on the massive scale of migration, what are some environmental impacts on local communities? How will the migration affect the local economy, will they take the already scarce opportunities in Southern Europe? Photos are not the ideal approach to answer profound social-economic questions.

        <br><br>
        However, I can’t help thinking, do the audience really care about the answers? Eight years later, do we still see news coverage about Syrian refugees in America or China? When we saw the photos, we offered our prayers and thoughts. That’s it. After all, it’s the life of others. Photos won’t solve the cruelty of human beings.
