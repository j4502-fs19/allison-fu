      <h1>Allison Fu</h1>
      <p>My name is Xueqing Fu (付雪晴), and I go by Allison. I am a senior at Mizzou, studying Data Journalism.
      <br> I attend Mizzou through a dual degree program between Communication University of China and University of Missouri- Columbia. I finished my first two years of college in Beijing, which is also my hometown.</p>

    <h1>1/23</h1>
    <p> Oddly enough, I am taking 4450 as a senior, in my last semester at Mizzou. I have forced myself to a place where I do not have alternatives but hang it there.<br>
Last semester, I dropped the reporting class, for my lack of time and confidence. <br>In the past week, I cried myself to bed several times, simply because I don’t think I will be able to make through. Plus, I do not know how to express my fear and discomfort to my family and friend.
Though I showed up in the budget meeting three times, I felt like an outsider. </p>

  <p>Some media are blaming Wuhanese for bring the disease to the entire nation and rest of the world, calling them perpetrators for traveling thousands of miles while on fever. Though the pandemic was first found in Wuhan and might be linked to the unsanitary food they consumed at the market. Do we really have to felonize their willingness to come home over Spring Festival and ignorance about the disease. <br>
Though there may be millions of Chinese taking the university entrance exam and there may be thousands of International student overseas, yet the college graduates only take up 5% of the total population. An average Chinese only spend 7.4 years in school, compared to 13+ years in the U.S.. How can we expect a 7th grade student to react calmly and self-quarantine for 14 days when it comes to disease and horror?<br>
My family lives a street across a top-ranked hospital, I saw patients visiting the hospital with their pillows and blankets ever since I was a child. I can still recall the pain and despair on their face. They are individuals who breathe and live not just numbers. It is ridiculously arrogant for media to blame the public.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow it will be my first GA shift. Am I terrified? Hell, yes. Did I cry last night? Yep, till 2 a.m. As an introvert person, I guess I will never overcome the fear of doing reporting. <br>I was having a really hard time at J2100, sometimes I just couldn't take the brutal honesty. Not once have I doubted why I chose journalism as my major? Well, I indeed enjoy the feeling of sharing others' stories and being immersed in data. The combination of both is just the best thing I can ever think of.<br> Hopefully, things will go smoothly when the sun rises.</p>

    <p>To be frank, I was worried that I don’t have enough time to have it written or people wouldn't be willing to talk to me when it comes to homelessness. <br>
Things turned out to be okay. Time passed more quickly than I expected. Also, I didn’t get the time to be panic or be stressed out. All I can think of is to have everything done as best as can. <br><br>

Besides, it’s my first time feeling frustrated for losing a potential story to another reporter. It's about the Spring Festival gala. The subject itself holds significant meaning to Chinese and the time, the breakout of the coranovirus in China, is sensitive to every Chinese.<br>
I was a child when SARS happened. Being required to stay home is the only memory I have of that pandemic. Now in 2020, I feel like a coward because of my detachment and my limited capability. Not only am I worried for my grandparents who lives a strret across the hospital, but also I feel guilty for not helping with anything. I should have donated medical masks days ealier. I should have warned my parents to keep their money from the market before the Spring Festival.
Now it seems to late.

    <h1>2/4</h1>
    <p>Though the coronavirus is not affecting me directly, nor do I notice the hostility against Chinese that happened in many places of the world, I can relate myself to some of the posts on social media. We are extremely vulnerable while facing hostility. As a Chinese living abroad, I felt the loneliness and rootlessness ever since my flight arrived in Seattle, 2018. <br>
I got even more cautious when the coronavirus broke out. How should I react if people treat me as a virus carrier? How should respond if anyone calls me a bat/dog eater? Chineses tourists got their notoriety for being disrespectful and rude.  At the time, my instinctive reaction is that “it’s not me.” Yet, I am a part of the larger community. The pride being a Chinese will always be with me, so is the guilt. Studying journalism makes the two ever more striking my life.<br>
I don’t know how others balance the pride and guilt. Or are they as sensitive as I am?

  <h1>2/15</h1>
  <p>To the fourth week of the class, I am getting a bit worried about my performance in the class. I haven’t contributed as much as I should over the past few weeks. I am doing what I was required, posting regularly on my website, showing up as frequently as possible, reading the paper, having interviews for my orientation assignment. Yet, I only have written during my GA shift. Personally, I do not feel comfortable writing on DDL, for which I missed several opportunities.<br>

Admittedly, I am struggling to stay on track. This never happened before, and I do not want to end up in giving up again. I have always been dedicated and involved in classes. Limited time is not an excuse for my lack of participation. It’s the path I chose. <br>

Plus, during my interview with Osasu Osaze, a doctoral student from Nigeria, I could personally relate to the feeling of being separated from the family. Because of the visa restriction, his family in Nigeria is unlikely to visit. And it’s too risky to go back. Osasu has to re-apply for his visa seven times to get back to MU and continue his study. <br>

Most likely, none of my parents will be able to come for my graduation, because of the cancellation of flights between the U.S. and China. </p>

    <p>Seeing Hannah’s reporting on the Spring Festival Gala, I reach out to Yang Li again. I am more than curious about her reaction to the extremely low attendance rate. I briefly talked to her before about the delay of the Gala and the reaction from the Chinese community towards the coronavirus. Beforehand, I only heard rumors. I have no doubt that it is polarized.
      <br>Four out of five co-organizers pulled from the event. She also has to bear the pressure from her own board members. Not mention the fear every individual has about the virus and its unpredictability.
As a Chinese, I am so appreciated that her organization, Columbia Friends of China, stayed. It’s not because of the culture or tradition, but it bridged me to my family. I indeed feel closer to my family, though being physically apart.
